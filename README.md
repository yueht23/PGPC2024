Introduction

The 2024 Allianz Practitioner’s Challenge centered on predicting insurance claims data with a high frequency of zero claims. Our team tackled this by evaluating various statistical and machine learning models tailored for zero-inflated data. 

 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

We conducted a thorough EDA to understand the data's distribution and characteristics, involving feature exploration, transformation, categorization, interaction, and extraction to ready the data for modeling. 

 

Tool Box 

We assessed a broad array of models and techniques: 

- Statistical Models: Including Generalized Linear Model (Naive Poisson), Zero-inflated models, and Hurdle models. 

- Machine Learning Models: Such as CANN, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, and AutoML. 

- Techniques for Imbalanced Data: Highlighting REBAGG (Resampled Bagging) and Deep Imbalanced Regression. 

Results 

Our findings were gauged on accuracy, efficiency, and metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and PDE (Poisson Deviance Error). We examined the balance between model complexity and performance, emphasizing hyperparameter tuning and ensemble techniques' roles in enhancing predictions. 


Conclusion 

Our investigation underscored the feasibility of applying a variety of models to tackle the zero-inflated claims data issue. Despite constraints regarding external data, computational resources, and timeline, we've established groundwork for future research, recommending the exploration of AI-driven vehicles' effects on insurance as a subsequent step.
